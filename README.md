# Buildkite Agent Hooks Example

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/fa1773bc74e3b4c38f6ecd29f32f714d153ced0dbd94b89ad9.svg?branch=main)](https://buildkite.com/buildkite/agent-hooks-example)

This repository demonstrates how to use [Buildkite Agent hooks](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/hooks) to control which teams may run pipelines on specific agents or groups of agents.

üëâ **See these examples in action:**

- ‚úÖ [Build with allowed team member](https://buildkite.com/buildkite/agent-hooks-example/builds/latest?branch=main)
- ‚ùå [Build rejected from unapproved user](https://buildkite.com/buildkite/agent-hooks-example/builds/latest?branch=rogue&state=failed)

See the full [Getting Started Guide](https://buildkite.com/docs/guides/getting-started) and [Buildkite Agent Overview](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3) for step-by-step instructions on how to get this running, or try it yourself:

## How it works

Buildkite agents expose [environment variables](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/configure/environment-variables#buildkite-environment-variables) about the jobs they run, and allow you to define [hooks](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/hooks) to customize job behavior.

This example uses the `environment` hook (located at [`agent/hooks/environment`](agent/hooks/environment)) to **restrict job execution based on team membership**.

The `environment` hook runs before code is checked out, making it ideal for early policy enforcement.

You can use this technique to:

- Restrict access to dedicated queues
- Enforce team-level separation on shared infrastructure
- Implement custom scheduling or resource constraints

---

## Setup

1. **Install the Agent Hook**

Install the `environment` hook on your agents:

  ```bash
    cp agent/hooks/environment /etc/buildkite-agent/hooks/environment
    chmod +x /etc/buildkite-agent/hooks/environment
  ```

  > üõ†Ô∏è If using [hosted agents](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/hosted-agents), the hook can be preinstalled during agent setup.

2. **Use Dedicated Queues (Optional)**

If you're using this policy on only some agents, isolate them using [dedicated queue][queues] .
